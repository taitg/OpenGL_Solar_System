Created and compiled using Visual C++ 2015 on Windows 10.

This program uses OpenGL to render an animated model of the Sun, Earth, Moon
and stars. It takes into account all real spatial relationships between them,
and sizes/distances are represented on a logarithmic scale.

The texture of the Sun and its colours are animated to make it appear more lifelike.

The Earth's oceans have more reflective specular lighting than the land, and cloud
layers are animated above its surface to make it appear more lifelike.
